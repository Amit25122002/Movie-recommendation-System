Movie-Recommendation-System

This project develops a user-friendly movie recommendation system designed to deliver accurate and relevant movie suggestions based on user preferences.

Objective of the Project
The Movie Recommendation System aims to achieve the following key objectives:

Personalized Recommendations: Tailor movie suggestions to individual user preferences.
Movie Analysis: Delve into various aspects of movies to enhance the recommendation quality.
Feature Extraction: Extract essential features such as genre, cast, and plot.
Similarity Computation: Compute similarities between movies to match users' tastes.
Algorithms Used
The system employs Content-Based Filtering, a technique that recommends movies based on their intrinsic features. It uses textual data such as movie descriptions or summaries, creating a unique representation for each movie. These representations are compared using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which helps identify similar movies by highlighting significant words. This method ensures that the system provides personalized and relevant movie recommendations.

The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle, offering a diverse and comprehensive collection of movie information to enhance the system's accuracy and variety of recommendations
